# DEEP LEARNING

## What is deep-learning ?

**Deep learning** is a complex **machine learning** algorithm . It is to learn the internal rules and representation levels of sample data. The information obtained in the learning process is very helpful to the interpretation of data such as text, images and sounds. Its **ultimate goal** is to enable the machine to have the same analysis and learning ability as human beings, and to recognize data such as characters, images and sounds.

### Feature Engineering

What **feature engineering** does is extract and generalize the features so that the algorithm can make the most of the data and get better results. In-depth learning, **feature engineering** can be automated

### Model evaluation

There are many kinds of model **evaluation indicators**. Select appropriate **evaluation indicators** according to different problems. The tasks performed by the **deep learning** model can be divided into two categories: **classification task** and **regression task**. Therefore, we also have different **indicators** to evaluate the model.
